        <p>In 2024 the Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded to the AlphaFold team for their strides in protein folding. Whilst this was an extraordinary feat it was one made possible by the access that the teams had to standardized data on protein structures in a common format, mandated by publishing requirements.</p>
        
        <p>Cancer research is increasingly evolving toward a multidisciplinary approach, driven by the scale, diversity, and sophistication of the available data, and by the data-processing tools and infrastructure associated with them. Yet finding and accessing cancer data remains extremely challenging.g In England alone there are 11 regional Secure Data Environments and over 100 Data Custodians listed on the HDRUK’s health data gateway.</p>

    <div class="content-section">
        <p>Cancer Research UK is aiming to improve the reuse of data funded by the charity, whilst continuing to put the patient first. To do this it is focusing on implementing the FAIR principles—making data that CRUK funds Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable—to accelerate the translation of big data into patient benefits. The CRUK Data Hub is central to this strategy.</p>
        
        <p>The Pearl lab at the University of Sussex has teamed up with CRUK to develop a metadata catalogue for their research datasets. Using the enormous power of the HDRUK health data gateway as a backend, we are giving it a new look, focusing on what cancer researchers really need to know about the datasets they are looking for:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Which cancers is the dataset focusing on? </li>
            <li>What type of data does it contain? </li>
            <li>What are the access conditions? </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In addition, the datahub will provide rich metadata about the datasets and link back to the health data gateway in order to streamline the access process. At the same time, we do not want to duplicate the HDRUK health data gateway so all data uploaded to the CRUK data hub will also be available through the gateway.</p>

        <p>The data hub will be up and running by the end of the year.</p>
