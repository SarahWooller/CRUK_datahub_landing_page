top_bar.html is a react html webpage that should be run using npm/vite.
To do this we take the following steps
1) Install Node.js

2) in the chosen directory initialize npm:
`npm init -y`
3) install vite
`npm install vite @vitejs/plugin-react react react-dom --save-dev`
4) Put the contents of the vite directory in the same directory.
5) Run the http://localhost:5173  using `npm run dev` and navigate to top_bar.html
   (others to follow)
6) critically this should give you a directory full of node modules in the vite directory. 
7) If they arent there you'll have to move them.
